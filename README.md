# PoGo-Poly-Bot
For running on your machine, you need to make sure you have npm/node js installation environment configured.
You'll probably need Python as well, takes some setup on a Windows environment.

Afterwards, run npm install --save discord.js to install discord.js as a dependency.  Also, check out package.json;
it contains all the other npm dependencies.  You can install these using npm install *dependencyName*.  Had about
7ish packages I had to install before the script would run.

To execute the script itself, run node index.js
If everything is set up properly, the above should return "I am ready!"

# Another side-note
Trevor is a really talented coder. He and I put a lot of time and effort into this bot.
We soon passed it on to Justin C., who is trying his hardest to keep it all together.
I'll be around to try and help Justin C. keep this bot together, but I don't know how long that will last.
If you ever see this Trevor, I just wanted to say thank you for everything that you've done.

# Final Update
I decided to create this update opening my GitHub for the first time in a long time.
If you couldn't tell by the extreme lack of updates (not including the README, the last update was about 3 years ago), the bot is dead.
I personally don't play PoGo anymore, which is why I dropped this project.
To all of you who used this bot, thank you for being a driving factor for its development!
